React application calculating a cost of mortgage loan using Cicero Financial Solutions (CFS).
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
